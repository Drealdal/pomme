6: rewrite makefile system
0.5: implement of rpc && thread_pool
	1: need test(4,1 deadline)
1:timeout of connections
2:concurrent write to storage file
	consider the number of current storage file,current storage file is an writable strogae file
	we can append storage file to an current storage file, one thread is response for a current
	storage file.(Not Continus write, if the size of write thread pool is not set to 1 ,use multi
	current file or lock to solve this problem)
3:the relation among client, data server (object server), meta server( file server) and master server()
4:check sum of the data
5:dedum, we only need to copy meta, inheritly copy on write, inheritly log structure
//
1. The logger sysetm should be reconsiderd
